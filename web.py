The meeting started promptly at 11:35 AM, with the presence of André Neiva, Rita Batista, Daniel Furtado, and Francisco Falcão. 
André opened the session by explaining the main objectives of the meeting, which involved presenting the models developed by the team, analyzing the previous meeting report, and discussing improvements for process automation. 
He also emphasized the importance of capturing objective data to enhance the quality of future training sessions and meetings. 
At the beginning, there was a brief exchange of views among participants on the need for an effective reporting system capable of providing valuable insights for trainers and organizations.

Following this introduction, André shared a report generated from the last meeting held two days ago. 
The document detailed the topics discussed, the effectiveness of the meeting, and member participation. 
Rita and Daniel shared their opinions on the report's content, noting that its structure was quite useful but that some aspects could be improved, such as the visual presentation of data and the inclusion of more detailed metrics on participant engagement. 
André mentioned that future versions of the report could include more intuitive graphs and customizable information to meet each user's specific needs.

The next agenda item addressed the effectiveness of training sessions and how technology can improve the teaching and learning process. 
André explained that one of the key functions of the tool they were developing was the ability to measure participant engagement in real-time.
This would allow trainers to identify moments of higher or lower attention from students and adjust their methodologies to maximize learning outcomes. 
Rita added that, in her experience, trainee motivation varies significantly depending on the nature of the training. 
For example, mandatory training sessions tend to generate less engagement, whereas optional courses attract more interested participants. 
Based on this observation, the team discussed the possibility of customizing reports to differentiate these scenarios and suggest specific interventions to improve student involvement.

Another important topic was the management of material access and training certification. 
Rita highlighted that many learning platforms restrict access to content once a course is completed, which can be detrimental to trainees who wish to review the material later. 
Francisco suggested creating a platform that would function as a centralized learning repository, where students could access their materials whenever needed. 
Comparisons were made with existing platforms like Moodle, but it became evident that the proposed solution would have a significant advantage by integrating different courses and training entities into a single accessible environment.

The meeting then moved on to the legal aspects of recording and processing participant data. 
Francisco explained that any recording would require explicit authorization and that it would be essential to ensure compliance with data protection regulations. 
Various approaches were considered to address potential concerns, such as anonymizing certain data or configuring a system that processes information without storing it permanently. 
André and Daniel reflected on the feasibility of these solutions, emphasizing that the technology could be adjusted to meet legal requirements without compromising the tool's functionality.

Next, the discussion turned to the potential expansion of the tool's use in academic settings, particularly at the University of Minho. 
Rita mentioned that the institution has a history of supporting innovative projects and could be a strategic partner for the initial implementation of the technology. 
André noted that he had already had a preliminary conversation with a university psychologist who expressed interest in the tool's potential to enhance the learning experience. 
The idea of scheduling a formal meeting with university representatives was well received, and Francisco suggested preparing a detailed presentation to highlight the platform's benefits.

Another topic discussed was the practical application of the technology in corporate training sessions. 
Rita shared a recent experience where evaluating training effectiveness was challenging due to a lack of objective data. With the developed tool, it would be possible to generate detailed reports on trainee performance and session dynamics. 
Francisco reinforced that adopting a continuous monitoring system could benefit both trainers and companies, providing a clearer overview of the return on investment in training programs.

In the final moments of the meeting, the next steps were reviewed. 
It was decided that an email would be sent to the University of Minho to formalize contact and schedule a meeting. 
Additionally, Francisco committed to consulting legal experts to ensure all legal issues were properly addressed before large-scale implementation. 
André mentioned that an initial test of the platform could be conducted in a controlled environment, allowing for adjustments before a broader rollout.

The meeting concluded with a positive sense of progress. 
All participants agreed that the discussions provided valuable insights for the project's evolution and that the next steps were well defined. 
It became clear that the developed technology has the potential to revolutionize how training sessions and meetings are conducted, offering an innovative method for performance analysis and monitoring. 
The expectation is that the upcoming implementation and testing phases will yield concrete results that confirm the benefits discussed throughout the meeting.
